title: A simple starter kit for Next.js with MDX
---

This is a simple starter kit that integrates Next.js with MDX using `next-mdx-remote`. It uses _CSS Modules_ for styling, which can be easily replaced with your preferred styling solution.

You can find the complete source code on [GitHub](http://github.com/cyishere/nextjs-starter).
