A simple post to demonstrate how a normal blog post looks on this starter. Content is all set in the "Body" field in the markdown/mdx files and Next.js transforms it into proper HTML post.

If you add a title attribute to the image and the front-end will automatically wrap it in a `<figure>` tag for you, and show the title in the `<figcaption>`.

You can also embed YouTube videos in posts using the `YouTube` custom component. The video ID is found in the URL after `v=` or after the last `/` in shortened URLs:

`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<this_is_the_id>`.

<YouTube id="zUnKDK1iklo" />

Finally, how about a `<blockquote>`?

> Consectetur labore cillum exercitation labore labore.

Remember, if you want a figure and caption, add a 'title' attribute to image in the body field.

Hopefully, this has demonstrated how simple it is to make a nice looking blog with this starter.
